AWS Cloud Support Technician | EC2, S3, CloudWatch, Terraform 
$28.00/hr 

I’m an entry-level AWS Cloud Support freelancer trained in real-world projects. I help startups and solo developers keep their AWS systems running, backed up, and cost-optimized without over-engineering.

Here’s what I do best:

Launch & troubleshoot EC2 servers

Automate S3 backups with Bash

Monitor usage & uptime with CloudWatch

Write clear step-by-step documentation

Use Terraform to quickly spin up infrastructure

I’ve built projects on EC2, S3, CloudWatch, and Terraform as part of a hands-on, job-focused AWS program. I don’t just know theory—I’ve actually done the work.

I’m your guy if you want:
✅ Clean, functional cloud setups
✅ Fast communication
✅ No drama, just delivery
